						<h4><b>About Website:</b></h4>
						<p>This website was created as a class project to learn different computer science skills like HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. It is a biography of myself which I have turned into a resume builder. My website will hopefully show any future employers that I have the skill set to build a website. It is not completely done from scratch since I have used a premade template but it is a learning process. This would be my first time ever creating something that can help portray all my skills and hopefully in time my whole website will become completely self-made from scratch. This specific page of my website is going to demonstrate how to maneuver around my website and explain how I used certain skills to end up with my finishing project.</p>
						<h4><b>Improvements:</b></h4>
						<p>The website is not perfect and is in need of improvements but for now I hope it is easy to use and not to hard to understand. Please email me with your feedback on how to improve my page and what else you would like to be seen on there. I will make sure to read your critics and make better improvements as I learn more on building a website.</p>

					<p><b>Site Navigation</b>
					</p>
					<p>This website is meant to be a resume and is set up to look like one. On the left hand side under the my self portrait picture, I have listed different ways to contact me by email and cell phone. Underneath that I have my skill sets in the Marketing and Computer World. As I progress my studies the percent of knowledge will increase as I learn more to benefit my majors. I have also listed different languages I speak and understand to explain my different culture background and my willingness to explore new ones. I have different hyperlinks to take you to another page to view my projects and applications I have completed in class. Now on the right side I have written a short biography of whom I am as a person and what I hope to aspire for my future. Then I have listed every class I have taken and need to take to graduate by Spring 2019 in my major. This gives a litte insight on what classes I have to look forward too and their difficultly levels. At the end I have listed a few references from previous and current jobs in hopes that any future employer can get a glowing recommendation on my merits and accomplishments. At the bottom on my page, I have listed the validations for my website. I am clean free from any errors and have created a wonderful website.</p>

					<p><b>Site Design</b>
					</p>
					<p>My site design is very simple. the use of teal, white and black colors shows a professional but enjoyable look. Everything is straightforward and out in the open. This website can be handy and accessible for a five year old all the way to senior citizens users. The website is meant to be a resume so when you first click on my website it shows my resume right in the front. Then to access any of my other works, you have to scroll down and click on the straightforward written out hyperlinks on the left hand columns.</p>

					<p><b>How To build A Website</b>
					</p>
					<p>Website building is actually a lot easier to do with the help of a pre-made template. For beginners, like myself, w3schools.com has been one of the best guides in building a website. You can learn how to code in different programs like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and so many more. They show you how to write in the correct format and how to tell the computer a command using the different code. This teaches you to be creative and adventurous. They give you the tarter but of course you have to use your imagination and create your own site. If you are using a Microsoft Computer, Notepad ++ is a perfect tool for writing the code for your index. If you are a Mac Computer user, like myself, then Sublime is the perfect tool to code. They are both easy to use and write on and all you have to do once you code your work is save it and just refresh your Internet page; viola your work is officially published.</p>
